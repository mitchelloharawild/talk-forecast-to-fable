#### Abstract

A well designed interface is instrumental in making software easy to learn and use. The design of statistical software is inherently subjective, and there are many difficult decisions involved in creating interfaces that work cohesively within the intended domain. In this talk, I will examine the design decisions made when creating fable, the tidy time series forecasting successor of the widely renowned forecast package.

#### Structure (WIP)

* Making R packages, existing tools available
* Design principles: flexibility, extensibility, generality
* Creating the building blocks
* Lessons learnt from the interface of forecast
* Embracing tidyverse design
* Specific comparisons between forecast and fable

### Format

20 minute talk.
