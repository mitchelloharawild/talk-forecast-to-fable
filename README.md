#### Abstract

A well designed interface is instrumental in making software easy to
learn and use. The design of statistical software is inherently
subjective, and there are many difficult decisions involved in creating
interfaces that work cohesively within the intended domain. In this
talk, I will examine the design decisions made when creating fable, the
tidy time series forecasting successor of the widely renowned forecast
package.
